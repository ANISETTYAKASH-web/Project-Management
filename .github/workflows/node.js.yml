    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the repository's code
      # This action checks out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE,
      # so your workflow can access it.
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up the Node.js environment
      # This action sets up a Node.js environment, which is required
      # to run npm commands. We'll use a modern LTS version.
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20' # You can change this to another LTS version like '18' or '22'

      # Step 3: Install project dependencies
      # This runs `npm install` to download all packages listed
      # in your package.json file.
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install Project-Management/server/package.json 

      # Step 4: Start the development server
      # This step executes the 'dev' script defined in your package.json.
      # This will start the application, but it's important to note that
      # this job will hang until the process is manually killed.
      # For a typical CI workflow, a dedicated test script is preferred.
      - name: Start application
        run: npm run dev
